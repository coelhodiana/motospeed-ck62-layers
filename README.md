# motorspeed-ck62-layers

This repo contains an [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) script written in Lua to fix the layers of Motorspeed CK62 keyboard on OSX.

- The modifier key is `alt`. 
- To make it properly working, the third layer must be active, you achieve this by hitting `fn + 3` for 5 seconds.
